# Intro
DeFi Services provide a unified, programmable interface for interacting with decentralized financial protocols, enabling developers to seamlessly access on-chain liquidity, execute swaps, manage yield strategies, and integrate lending, staking, and other DeFi primitives through consistent APIs. 

Designed for composability and abstraction, these services eliminate protocol-level complexity, making it easy to build advanced financial applications, automation flows, and cross-chain strategies with minimal overhead.
