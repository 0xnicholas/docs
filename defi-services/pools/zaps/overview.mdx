The Zaps API provides a unified interface for entering and exiting complex DeFi positions using a single token. It automatically handles all underlying operations—swaps, routing, token splits, liquidity provisioning, staking, or vault deposits—so developers can offer seamless one-click onboarding into liquidity pools, yield vaults, LSD/LRT positions, structured products, or RWA strategies. By abstracting away multi-step interactions and protocol-specific logic, the Zaps API enables developers to integrate advanced DeFi functionality with minimal code and without needing to manage execution pathways, slippage, or protocol differences.
