# Overview
Monoli DEX Infrastructure is a decentralized exchange infrastructure that enables developers to build and operate their own DEXs on top of a shared, non-custodial trading backend.
Monoli does not operate a user-facing exchange. Instead, it serves as a DEX white-label foundation, allowing teams to launch fully customized decentralized exchanges while relying on Monoli for core trading infrastructure.

At its core, Monoli provides a shared execution and liquidity layer designed for decentralized trading. DEXs built on Monoli access a common matching and settlement layer, enabling deeper liquidity and more efficient price discovery without sacrificing application-level independence.

All trading on Monoli follows a non-custodial execution model. Users retain control of their assets at all times, and trade outcomes are settled through verifiable, decentralized processes rather than centralized accounts or custodial balances.

Monoli is built for developers who want to launch professional-grade DEXs without rebuilding exchange infrastructure from scratch.

Core components such as matching, risk management, liquidation, and settlement are provided as reusable modules, allowing teams to focus on product differentiation rather than backend complexity.

Monoli follows a modular architecture, enabling developers to adopt the full stack or integrate individual components depending on their use case.


## Built for Developers
Monoli is designed for:
- Teams launching spot or perpetual DEXs
- Wallets embedding native exchange functionality
- Protocols operating application-specific markets
- Builders seeking shared liquidity without centralized custody

## Why Monoli?

Decentralized exchanges have historically faced challenges such as fragmented liquidity, duplicated infrastructure, and high operational overhead.

Monoli addresses these challenges by providing a shared, decentralized trading foundation that:
- Reduces liquidity fragmentation
- Eliminates the need to rebuild exchange infrastructure
- Enables faster iteration and product differentiation
- Preserves non-custodial and verifiable execution guarantees
