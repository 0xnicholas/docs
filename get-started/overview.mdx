Monoli Platform is a unified CeDeFi capability layer that provides developers with standardized APIs for trading, DeFi, payments, bots, and identity across multiple chains and centralized venues. 
It abstracts heterogeneous liquidity, protocols, and account systems into a coherent API-led architecture, enabling builders to create advanced trading systems, automated agents, Solver-based applications, 
and CeDeFi-native user experiences without managing direct integrations, fragmented state, or protocol-specific complexity. 
Through its modular services—Unified Trading, DeFi Services, PayFi, Bots, and Crypto Passport—Monoli delivers a comprehensive execution, liquidity, 
and identity fabric designed for high-performance applications in the CeDeFi ecosystem.

Platform has five main service categories: Unified Trading API, DeFi Services, PayFi Services, Bots and Crypto Passport.
