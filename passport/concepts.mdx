# What Is an Agent Account?
An Agent Account is a programmable, identity-anchored account abstraction that represents a user (or an organization) across multiple execution domains and is capable of autonomous, delegated, and policy-constrained actions.
It extends the traditional notion of a blockchain account by introducing identity semantics, cross-domain execution capability, and state-aware behavior.

In formal terms:

> An Agent Account is an identity-controlled computational agent that owns assets, executes actions, delegates authority, and maintains synchronized state across heterogeneous environments such as CeFi platforms, DeFi protocols, and off-chain services.

It is not merely an address, nor a wallet; it is a subject entity that can act, reason, authorize, and synchronize on behalf of the user.

# CeDeFi Unified Account Model
The CeDeFi Unified Account Model defines a single logical account that spans traditional custodial infrastructure (CeFi) and decentralized execution environments (DeFi). It enables a user’s identity, asset ownership, permissions, and execution capabilities to operate cohesively across heterogeneous domains without requiring fragmentation into separate accounts, keys, or trust configurations.

At its core, the model integrates identity, authorization, and state/execution into one coherent structure—implemented as a Crypto Passport Agent Account.

### Motivation
Historically, users have maintained two disjoint account paradigms:
- CeFi accounts, managed via custodial identities, API keys, and centralized ledgers.
- DeFi accounts, controlled by private keys or smart accounts on-chain.
These accounts are incompatible in identity semantics, permission models, execution rules, and settlement guarantees. As a result, users lack:
- A unified view of their asset state.
- A single identity controlling all actions.
- Cross-domain automation.
- Consistent and programmable authorization policies.
The CeDeFi Unified Account Model resolves these inconsistencies by abstracting both domains into a single agent-controlled system.
