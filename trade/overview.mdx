# Introduction
Unified Trade provides a unified CeDeFi (Centralized + Decentralized Finance) trading abstraction layer that integrates account abstraction, trade execution, strategy orchestration, and cross-platform connectivity.

It empowers developers to manage the full trading lifecycle—account creation, trade signaling, execution, and ecosystem integration—through standardized APIs, removing the complexity of bridging exchanges and DeFi protocols.
